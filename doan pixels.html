				<h1> Photoshop! </h1>
					
				<p> Photoshop went pretty smoothly for me and I enjoyed using it a lot. I’ve used plenty of raster programs in the past for drawing so a lot of Photoshop’s features were already familiar to me. For this project, we were tasked with making a collage of ourselves. I took inspiration from the fantasy computer graphics from the old days and used unused assets from another project. I also just love the cottagecore/fairycore aesthetic, which makes a collage very fitting. </p>
