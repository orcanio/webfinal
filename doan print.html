				<h1> InDesign! </h1>
					
				<p> InDesign was pretty okay. I had an easier time when working on projects with fewer pages than with multiple-page projects. I fell a bit behind on this project because I just couldn't think of any ideas. Eventually, I decided just to do something a bit silly as that was my mood at that time. It was originally supposed to be a "manipulator music" guide but I would have to explain a lot of things, so it was scaled back to just a few artists I like. </p>
