				<h1> Illustrator! </h1>
					
				<p> Illustrator was pretty hard as Iâ€™m so used to drawing in raster-based programs. It was my first time working with vectors and it was definitely harder than it looks. For this project, we could either design a character or a logo. Because of my lack of expertise in vector drawing, I went with a logo instead. This logo is for a fictional shop from one of my stories. It is a family-owned business that makes soap, perfume, and lotion! The story also takes place in France, hence why the text is in French. </p>
